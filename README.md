📊 AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard

Task 1 | Internship Project

🚀 Project Summary

This project was completed as Task 1 during my internship, focusing on building an AI-powered sales forecasting solution to predict future sales trends using historical retail data. The objective was to apply data science and machine learning concepts to generate actionable business insights through forecasting and visualization.

🎯 Business Objective
	•	Forecast future sales trends to support planning and decision-making
	•	Identify seasonality and long-term sales patterns
	•	Provide a clear comparison between Actual vs Forecasted Sales
	•	Deliver a scalable baseline solution for future analytical tasks

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
	•	Time Series Forecasting
	•	Trend & Seasonality Analysis
	•	Regression-Based Modeling
	•	Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
	•	Data Visualization & Storytelling
	•	Version Control with Git & GitHub

🛠 Technology Stack
	•	Programming: Python
	•	Libraries: Pandas, Prophet, Scikit-learn
	•	Visualization: Matplotlib, Power BI
	•	Tools: Git, GitHub

📂 Dataset
	•	Retail sales data (daily / weekly / monthly)
	•	Aggregated to monthly level for time-series forecasting

⚙️ Technical Approach
	1.	Cleaned and preprocessed raw sales data
	2.	Resampled time-series data for consistency
	3.	Built forecasting models using Prophet
	4.	Generated 12-month future sales predictions
	5.	Conducted category-wise and region-wise analysis
	6.	Visualized forecast results and trends
	7.	Exported structured outputs for reporting and dashboards


📈 Key Deliverables
	•	Sales forecasting model with future predictions
	•	Visualizations showing:
	•	Actual vs Forecasted Sales
	•	Trend and seasonality patterns
	•	Forecast tables for further business analysis
	•	Dashboard-ready outputs for Power BI

📊 Impact
	•	Enabled data-driven insights into future sales behavior
	•	Improved understanding of seasonal demand patterns
	•	Provided a structured forecasting pipeline for business use cases

🔮 Future Improvements
	•	Model comparison (ARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM)
	•	Forecast accuracy evaluation (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
	•	Interactive dashboards
	•	Automated data pipelines
